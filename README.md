# Getting Started with DogGo NYC

A light-weight mobile website that allows users to find the dog run closest to them when they are out and about in New York City with their pup.

## Who am I?

My name is Meredith Cornelius. I'm a student at the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. I also have a very social, very needy chihuahua named Reggie. Because of the pandemic, she has crippling separation anxiety. This means I need to take her everywhere I GO! And its helpful to know where the nearest dog parks are whenever I'm out and about with her. Thanks, Reggie, for the inspiration.

## How do you interact with it?

When you need to tire your pup out, pull out your cellphone and put in the above address. If you allow your location to be shared, the map will place a pin on the map where you are and zoom in to reveal the closest dog run. (If you don't allow your location to be shared, you'll be shown a )

Regardless of whether you allow your location or not, you can zoom in further to reveal the size of each dog run. You can also click on the paw icon to see additional information about each dog park. If you favorite a dog park, the paw icon will be replaced with a yellow star.
